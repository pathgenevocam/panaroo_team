# panaroo_team

*Comments*
Work in progress--email or slack me if you have any trouble adding to our new repo.
I added separate folders for code and data for basic organisation (feel free to change/expand). 
# (?) Is it ok to host a copy of all data here, or should I leave it in the MRC cloud?

*Useful commands* 
Set-up:

    git clone git@github.com:pathgenevocam/panaroo_team.git
    cd panaroo_team
    git checkout caitlin  # replace caitlin w your branch name
    
Push local changes to repo: 

    git add -A
    git commit -m "did something useful"
    git status
    git push origin caitlin  # replace caitlin w your branch name
